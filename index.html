<h1>Woof qtile config</h1>
<p>Yea, yet another qtile user making a dumb config.
I won't provide the wallpaper tho
and the screenshot, since its... dynamic!</p>
<hr />
<p>For this config to work as intended, you need to have and configure other stuff like autowall (I made that myself haha).</p>
<p>All the needed scripts are located in the <code>./resources</code> folder.</p>
<p>after cloning this repo,
make the installer.sh an executable and run the file.</p>
<p>This should install and setup auto-wallpaper as long as this clone is located as <code>~/.config/qtile</code></p>
<p>You also need to install all the fonts located in <code>./resources/fonts</code></p>
<p>and then run <code>autowall</code> (you dont have to after a logout)</p>
