## Please follow the steps below before messaging me and being like: I can't install this dum thing

For this config to work as intended, you need to have and configure other stuff like autowall (I made that myself haha).

All the needed scripts are located in the `./resources` folder.

after cloning this repo,
make the installer.sh an executable and run the file.

This should install and setup auto-wallpaper as long as this clone is located as `~/.config/qtile`

You also need to install all the fonts located in `./resources/fonts`

and then run `autowall` (you dont have to after a logout)
